## 🔥 About

**Diavolo's Eternal Suffering** is a chaotic, animated, and constantly evolving death simulator inspired by *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. Powered by recursive death logic, cursed background glitches, JoJo GIFs from Tenor, and a button that lets you *immortalize the suffering* via screenshot — this is the punishment Diavolo truly deserves.

### 🌀 Features

- 📅 Tracks total deaths since **GER** activated (Nov 16, 2022).
- 🧠 Generates **random, layered JoJo-style deaths** every 30 seconds.
- 🎨 Backgrounds shift with every demise — pure chaos.
- 🎭 Displays **random JoJo GIFs** using the **Tenor API**.
- 🖼️ Screenshot the suffering with a single click.
- 🔥 **HELL MODE** (`H`) → increases death frequency.
- 💢 **FULL CHAOS** (`C`) → triggers ultra-glitch visual insanity.
